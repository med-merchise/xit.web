# pyenv, pipenv, poetry lock files
#   Committing these files to VC is important because it will cause anyone who
#   sets up the project to use the exact same versions of the dependencies
#   that you are using.  However, in case of collaboration, if having
#   platform-specific dependencies or dependencies having no cross-platform
#   support, your packaging and dependency management may install dependencies
#   that don't work, or not install all needed dependencies.  For a library or
#   package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is intended
#   to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version
